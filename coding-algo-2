Count the frequency of each word, and sort the words with a custom ordering relation that uses these frequencies. Then take the best k of them.

Python

class Solution(object):
    def topKFrequent(self, words, k):
        count = collections.Counter(words)
        candidates = count.keys()
        candidates.sort(key = lambda w: (-count[w], w))
        return candidates[:k]
