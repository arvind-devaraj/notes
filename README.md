# Machine Learning

If you just want an entry-level position I don't see the need to know anything past Naive Bayes, LDA, and SVM which you can get from most common numpy + scipy packages. **Linear algebra** will help, but if you understand principal component analysis and singular value decomposition then these things above are 80% of the theory you will need in practice.

I would study harder on learning how to get good features more than anything else to be honest. Classifiers are a well-understood mathematical science at this point. Knowing how to get good features and build good kernels is where the biggest bang for your employment buck might be in more advanced roles.
